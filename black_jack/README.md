## Black Jack APP

- This is a black jack app using vanilla JavaScript and some basic styling. There's some DOM manipulation and simple math to make this game work.

- I am getting a lot of practice with making my functions logical and flow naturally. I'm also trying to write as much clean code as possible and make it easy to read. 

- Thanks to Scrimba and their JS Cohort I am able to practice my current skills and improve on my JS development.
